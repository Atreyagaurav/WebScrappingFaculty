1227,Damian E Helbling,https://www.cee.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/damian-e-helbling,https://www.cee.cornell.edu,deh262@cornell.edu,Research Interests:Helbling is interested in water quality as it relates to human and ecosystem health. He is particularly interested in investigating the chemical and biological processes that influence contaminant fate and nutrient cycling in natural and engineered aquatic systems. One major research thrust has focused on biotransformation processes acting on trace organic contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and pesticides in natural and engineered biological systems. Research in this area has involved the experimental elucidation of the chemical and biological determinants of these processes by uniquely combining state-of-the-art analytical techniques from the fields of environmental analytical chemistry and environmental microbiology. Novel data mining and data processing tools are being developed to parse large dataset acquisitions and discover predictive chemical and biological descriptors of these processes. The overall goals of Helbling's broader research program are to develop: (i) mechanistic models for contaminant fate and exposure risk assessment; (ii) next-generation water treatment and resource recovery technologies; and (iii) comprehensive and sustainable management strategies for urban water systems.

His approach is to use field measurements to understand the controls on vertical fluxes and spatial turbulence modeling to draw inferences of the impacts of spatial variability on the large-scale exchange rates. The field efforts have been focused on semi-arid regions (e.g. Southern Great Plains, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Mediterranean), where water limitations constrain the dynamics. The modeling efforts have included the pseudo-spectral Large Eddy Simulation (LES) code that he developed during his PhD and later extended to incorporate remotely sensed land surface fields as boundary conditions, and to contain embedded vegetation canopies."

1239,Pete J. Diamessis,https://www.cee.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/pete-j-diamessis,https://www.cee.cornell.edu,peter.diamessis@cornell.edu,"Research Interests:Peter Diamessis's research at Cornell is focused along two main themes. One is the development of high-accuracy and high-resolution spectral quadrilateral subdomain penalty techniques for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations which enable as realistic as possible an approximation to the environmental flow processes of interest. The other consists of using these techniques as the driver of highly parallel simulations which provide an accurate description of the relevant physical phenomena over as broad a range and separation of scales and as long a duration as possible. One group of phenomena of primary interest are high Reynolds number localized stratified turbulence and its remote and subsurface signature, as driven by the radiated internal wave field and its interaction with currents and sharp variations in the ambient density profile and the near-surface region of the ocean. The other area of physical interest is the study of instabilities and turbulence in the interior and under internal solitary waves propagating in environments of variable depth and stratification and currents and the associated impact on particle dynamics. Research topics include: Environmental fluid mechanics (turbulence, mixing, internal waves in the open/coastal ocean and in lakes), direct numerical simulation and large eddy simulation of stratified flows, modeling turbulence/turbulent mixing in geophysical flows, hydrodynamic instability theory, interaction of hydrodynamics and biology in natural ecosystems, computational engineering, numerical analysis, stable high accuracy spectral/spectral multidomain computational methods for high Reynolds number flows in complex geometries, high performance parallel scientific computing, scientific visualization."
1240,Ruth E. Richardson,https://www.cee.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/ruth-e-richardson,https://www.cee.cornell.edu,rer26@cornell.edu,"Research Interests:Dr. Richardson's research group studies the activities of populations within microbial communities through the study of genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics. While DNA-based techniques still serve as an anchoring point in bioenvironmental engineering, gene presence and characterization only provide insights into potential activity. Instantaneous activity levels are much more tightly tied to RNA and protein (particularly enzymatic proteins). With the wealth of information obtainable by querying RNA and protein pools, it is not only possible to determine whether a particular gene is being expressed under certain conditions, but it is also possible to use the data to develop molecular biomarkers of specific activities in environmental and reactor systems. The main techniques used by the group are quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRTPCR) to assay RNA pools, microarrays, and tandem mass spectrometry of biomarker peptides. Together these methods provide a wealth of information about the enzymes and other proteins being expressed by individual populations within a consortium of organisms. The main application of these ""omics"" is the study of consortia containing Dehalococcoides ethenogenes - the first organism shown to bioremediate chlorinated ethenes (perchloroethene - PCE - and trichloroethene - TCE) to harmless ethene gas. The key challenges the lab is focused on are honing the list of key biomarkers of dehalorespiration and quantitatively relating net expression levels to bulk activity (in this case net dehalorespiration rates). Additionally, stress biomarkers can inform bioremediation efforts in the field. Information on in situ stresses felt by key populations can guide site managers to effective actions to take to jump start failing bioremediation efforts. Myriad proteomic techniques are also employed by the lab to better identify key oxidoreductase enzymes expressed by iron and sulfate reducing bacteria that can bioremediate Uranium contamination in groundwater. Another focus in the lab is the growth of high-lipid producing algae as biofuel feedstock. While algae are reported to be up to 100 times more productive per-acre than land plants, and they can be grow on marginal lands and in saline environments (minimizing competition for land for food crops) many challenges still exist with respect to sustainable commercial scale algae growth and harvesting. This research involves genomic and transcriptomic characterization of high-performing marine algal strains being selected for growth in pilot scale facilities. A final thrust in the Richardson lab is the development of human waste treatment systems that are low cost, robust, and suitable for deployment in regions of the world (the ""Global South"") where economic, energy, and technical expertise constraints must all be considered."

He investigated and contributed to the mitigation of the effects of extreme events, including natural hazards and human threats, on civil infrastructure systems. He developed techniques for evaluating ground movement patterns and stability for a variety of excavation, tunneling, micro-tunneling, and mining conditions. He developed analytical methods and siting strategies to mitigate pipeline and tunnel damage during earthquakes, analyzed and designed high pressure pipelines, and established full-scale testing facilities for underground facilities and pipelines.

Dr. Krakowiak obtained his Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from the University of Minho, Portugal, where he focused on the experimental micromechanics of construction materials. His current research activities include advanced experimental analysis and modeling of cement-based materials under thermo-chemo-mechanical loads including high temperature and pressure, cement geochemistry, development of novel reduced-aging and carbon neutral cement-based materials, and the effect nuclear radiation on the physical and mechanical properties of calcium-silicate-hydrates. Results of his research on chemo-mechanical analysis of cementitious materials, from the nano-scale to the macro-scale of engineering applications, has been published in various journals including Cement and Concrete Research, Nature Communications, and recently Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. He is an active member of the TRB committee on Basic Research and Emerging Technologies Related to Concrete - AFN10."
