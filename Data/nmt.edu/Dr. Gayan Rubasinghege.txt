Research InterestsDr. Rubasinghege’s research revolves around nanomaterial, polymer composite and environmental
                     chemistry, studying hidden reaction pathways and mechanisms in environmental processes
                     to better understand the impact of mineral oxides and engineered nanoparticles on
                     poorly understood environmental process. One of his projects focuses on (i) how and
                     why different metal oxides and engineered nanoparticles behave differently during
                     their environmental processing under various environmentally relevant conditions and
                     (ii) the potential impacts of these processes on aquatic life and human health. These
                     interdisciplinary studies specifically focus on effects of particle size (nano vs.
                     micro), ionic strength, organic and inorganic pollutants and solar radiation on chemical
                     reactivity and environmental processing of metal oxides in mineral dust as a source
                     of trace metals to aquatic life, and their follow up aqueous phase behaviors.
