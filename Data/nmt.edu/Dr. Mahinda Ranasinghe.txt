Research InterestsThe research interests of Dr. Ranasinghe's group is centered on physical chemistry
                     and spectroscopy.  Yet our research is predominantly multidisciplinary. Research in
                     the group is mainly focused on the developments of novel nano-photonic materials for
                     solar energy related applications such as solar energy conversion, photocatalysis
                     and photovoltaics.
