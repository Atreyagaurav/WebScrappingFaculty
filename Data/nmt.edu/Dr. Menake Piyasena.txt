Research InterestsThe Bio-analytical and Microfluidics research group at NMT primarily focuses on developing
                     novel analytical and bio-analytical methods for environmental, biological, and chemical
                     analysis. The on-going projects explore the development of microsphere and polymer
                     monolith based bio-assemblies as reactive surfaces for target binding. These bio-assemblies
                     will be utilized in disease diagnostics. In another approach, bio-reactive surfaces
                     are integrated with microfluidic systems to create portable detection systems. Our
                     group also involve in developing sound wave-based microfluidic bio-analytical systems.
                     This includes the development of silicon and aluminum-based microfluidic systems for
                     bacteria, viruses, mammalian cells, and micro and nano particle separation. Our group
                     also has interests in developing microfluidic based techniques for the removal of
                     toxic chemicals like Bis-phenol A and particulate matter like nano and microplastics
                     in aqueous systems.
