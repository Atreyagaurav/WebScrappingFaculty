Research InterestsThe research projects in Dr. Heagy’s lab involve synthetic organic chemistry as a
                     fundamental technique for new dye synthesis. Theory and photophysics play an important
                     role in this research as the group employs various spectroscopies, i.e. UV-Vis, fluorescence
                     as well as quantum computational studies for the rational design of functional dyes. 
                     The applications of this research lead to fluorescent biomarkers, white-organic light
                     emitting devices as well as dye-doped nanocomposites for solar energy conversion.
