Research InterestsOur lab seeks to use chemistry to advance the understanding of biological processes
                     involved in disease inception, progression and resistance development. Using natural
                     products as inspiration and starting point, we are developing bioactive molecules
                     with improved activities and desirable pharmacological profiles. The design of novel
                     synthetic methodologies and their application to concise and practical synthetic sequences
                     in our lab will allow rapid access to these biologically relevant molecules and their
                     analogs.
