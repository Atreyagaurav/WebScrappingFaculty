Research InterestsDr. Pias' research group uses high-performance computing to investigate mechanisms
                     of biomolecular function through simulations of structural dynamics (with AMBER software,
                     primarily). Current projects are biomedically related, focusing on the significance
                     of lipids as modulators of cellular-level oxygen diffusion and, therefore, of aerobic
                     metabolism. Her group is specifically interested in clarifying the role of high membrane
                     cholesterol in cancer pathology as well as explaining the well-known connection between
                     insulin resistance and saturated fat accumulation in skeletal muscle.
