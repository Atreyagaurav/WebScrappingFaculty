Research InterestsPreserving the structural and functional integrity of genetic information is critical
                     for all organisms. DNA is susceptible to various kinds of damage from exposure to
                     endogenous (e.g., reactive oxygen species) and exogenous factors (e.g., radiation).
                     All the organisms have evolved intricate mechanisms involving numerous DNA repair
                     proteins to detect and repair multitude of DNA lesions. Mutations in genes encoding
                     DNA repair proteins lead to genomic instability that is a hallmark of several debilitating
                     diseases including cancer. Complex processes of DNA repair are regulated by interplay
                     of protein-protein/DNA-protein interactions and are required for preserving genomic
                     integrity and avoiding carcinogenesis. Identifying, characterizing and understanding
                     biological significance of such interactions are essential steps for developing potential
                     anti-cancer therapy.
