Research InterestsThe overarching theme of Dr. Snow’s research group could be labeled as, ‘photochemistry
                  in environmental systems’. One of the group’s aims is to approach the practical challenge
                  of developing low-cost, sustainable, and robust water treatment systems by investigating
                  the underlying science of the technologies. Another topic of interest is the examination
                  of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, which are toxic, petroleum related compounds)
                  in salt marsh ecosystems; specifically, what role do photochemical reactions play
                  in the transformation of PAHs found in salt marsh ecosystems.
