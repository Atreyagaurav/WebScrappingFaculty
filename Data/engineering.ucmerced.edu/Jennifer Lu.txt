Research Interests: Professor Lu's Functional Materials Laboratory conducts fundamental scientific investigation aiming for creating new transducer materials, capable of efficiently converting one type of energy (or force) into another. Through design, synthesis, fabrication and characterization of molecular- and nano- building blocks that are arranged in a spatially predefined manner, these new platforms could enable technological breakthroughs in fields spanning from life science to green energy to soft robotics. Current research projects are:
Low-energy Driven Thermal Contraction Polymer System
3D Nanocarbon Monolith for Sustainable Energy
Dynamic hydrogel for exerting spatiotemporal forces for Stem Cell Differentiation
