Research Interests: Using a wide range of analytical methods (infra-red spectroscopy, electron microsocpy, x-ray absorption spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy), Professor Traina's group studies:
Chemical transformations of pollutants in soils, surface and ground water
Linkages between chemical form or speciation of particular pollutants and their relative toxicities in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems
Roles of geoparticle surfaces and bacteria in pollutant fate
Current projects include the study of:
Contaminants at Department of Energy waste sites (Cr, Pu and U)
Role of Fe(II) and HSe- in transformations of nitroaromatic pesticides in wetlands
Fate of pharmaceuticals in the surface waters of National Parks
