Research Interests: Professor Chin's studies have focused on the application of polymer physics, microfabrication and engineering principles to biological systems. The application of the theory and tools from engineering in his work has initiated many innovative and productive research projects. These studies have brought us a better understanding of natural phenomena from the unique perspective of engineering. Professor Chin's current research plans include:
Intracellular Ca2+ signaling in acute pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
Applications of microfabrication techniques to study microenvironment effects on stem cell differentiation
Spontaneous polymer gel assembly in aqueous environment Intracellular and intercellular signaling in unicellular phytoplankton cells
