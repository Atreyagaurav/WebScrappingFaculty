Research InterestsAlbertson's work is generally directed toward the development of a comprehensive understanding of the exchange rates of mass (e.g. water and CO2), energy, and momentum between the land and atmosphere. His approach is to use field measurements to understand the controls on vertical fluxes and spatial turbulence modeling to draw inferences of the impacts of spatial variability on the large-scale exchange rates. The field efforts have been focused on semi-arid regions (e.g. Southern Great Plains, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Mediterranean), where water limitations constrain the dynamics. The modeling efforts have included the pseudo-spectral Large Eddy Simulation (LES) code that he developed during his PhD and later extended to incorporate remotely sensed land surface fields as boundary conditions, and to contain embedded vegetation canopies.
Current efforts are directed toward: i) mobile sensing to identify fugitive methane emissions in oil and gas production regions; 2) probabilistic prediction of wind energy production for improved grid integration; 3) sensor-model fusion to improve understanding of air quality dynamics in urban settings; and 4) the impacts of climate change/variability on water resources in semi arid regions.
