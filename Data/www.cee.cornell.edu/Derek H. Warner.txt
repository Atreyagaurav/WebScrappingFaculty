Research InterestsDerek is the current director of the Cornell Fracture Group. The group conducts both scientific and engineering research aimed at understanding and predicting the deformation and failure of structures. A primary scientific goal of the group is to illuminate and model the underlying physical mechanisms that control the failure of engineering materials. The group's effort in this area supports the group's engineering objective to advance the capability to predict the deformation and failure of structures through the utilization of new knowledge and modeling techniques. Through its research, the Cornell Fracture Group strives to increase the standard of living across the globe by enabling better performing, lower cost, and more sustainable technologies.
