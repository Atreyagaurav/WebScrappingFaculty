Research InterestsThe Nepf Lab studies the interaction of flow with aquatic vegetation and the feedbacks to sediment transport, chemical flux and ecosystem function. We develop models for physical processes that determine how vegetated habitats (green infrastructure), such as seagrasses, salt marsh, and mangroves, provide coastal protection, mitigate anthropogenic nutrient and pollutant loads, and provide blue carbon reservoirs, with the goal of applying these models to improve the management of natural resources and the design of green infrastructure.
