Research InterestsProfessor Ulm’s research interests are in the mechanics and structures of materials. His research group is looking at the nano- and micro mechanics of porous materials, such as concrete, rocks and bones; in the durability mechanics of engineering materials and structures; in computational mechanics; and in the bio-chemo-poromechanics of high-performance composite materials.
