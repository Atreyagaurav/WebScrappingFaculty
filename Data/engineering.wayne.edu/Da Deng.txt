Research InterestsOur research focuses on the development of next-generation electrochemical energy storage devices which will play important roles in employing green energy as future energy sources. In addition, the popularity of personal mobile electronic devices and the expanding market of electric vehicles constantly demand for better electrochemical energy storage devices, such as rechargeable batteries. We investigate green energy-storage materials for next-generation electrochemical energy storage devices. Our goals are to improve their electrochemical performances in terms of specific energy, power density, safety, cyclability, as well as to reduce their overall environmental footprint and cost. We develop innovative environmental remediation technology and obtain basic understanding of photo-detoxification in water treatment. Moreover, we investigate fundamentals of structure-property-performance relationships.
