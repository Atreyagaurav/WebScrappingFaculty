Interests:Computational multiscale mechanics for porous and particulate materials.
Mechanics of single phase (dry) and multiphase (partially-saturated and saturated, multi-constituent) porous materials, such as geomaterials (soil, rock), concrete, and soft biological tissues.
Damaged polycrystalline metals.
Generalized continuum theories for multiscale modeling of inelastic deformation.
Applications include modeling geotechnical, geological, and structural engineering failures, high strain rate loading of polycrystalline metals and soils, and visco-poroelastic response of ocular tissues and other biological tissues.
