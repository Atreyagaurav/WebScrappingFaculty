Research Interests: Stephen Levine's research interests are on the applications of mathematical and computer models to environmental, ecological, economic, and engineering systems. Much of this falls within the new field of industrial ecology. His most recent research areas include the use of economic input-output models in analyzing the flows of resources and products in industrial systems and the use of computer simulation to evaluate alternative policies for controlling feral cat populations.
