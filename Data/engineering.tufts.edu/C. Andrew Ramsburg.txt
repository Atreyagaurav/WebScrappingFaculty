Research Interests: Andrew Ramsburg’s research aims to improve environmental quality through understanding, modeling, and harnessing transport and reaction processes occurring in multiphase systems.  Often the overall goal in these projects is the development or improvement of technologies employed to characterize, manage, or treat organic contaminants in the environment.  Areas of application include emulsion transport and delivery in porous media, fate of emerging contaminants in biological treatment units, biotransformation and microorganism transport, and DNAPL source zone characterization and remediation.  Specific areas of expertise include multiphase flow and transport in porous media, liquid-liquid and solid-liquid equilibria, sols and emulsions, surfactants and interfaces, mass transfer, and biotransformations.
