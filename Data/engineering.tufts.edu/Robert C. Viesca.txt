Research Interests: Robert Viesca's research focuses on theoretical mechanics in earth sciences and engineering. Problems of recent interest include surficial and crustal processes, like landsliding, seafloor sedimentation, fault rupture initiation and propagation. That research involved the fields of seismology, tectonophysics, civil and environmental engineering, ocean sciences, and hydrology, and the mechanics behind friction, fracture, porous media flow and deformation.
