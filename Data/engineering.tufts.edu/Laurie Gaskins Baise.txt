Research Interests: Laurie Baise's work in the Geohazards Research Lab addresses hazards such as earthquakes and extreme wind, and links predictive models with observational data. She is an expert in earthquake site response and regional seismic hazard mapping. Baise's recent research focuses on regional mapping for rapid response and loss estimation. Baise and her students are interested in both developing predictive models to predict damage extent and using remotely sensed imagery and automated classification techniques to develop damage extent maps immediately following natural hazard events.
