Research Interests: Dick Plumb's primary research interest is to understand and predict how rocks deform in response to loads imposed by drilling and extracting fluids from reservoirs located deep in sedimentary basins. Currently, he is collaborating with Research Professor Jack Germaine in the Tufts Advanced Geomaterials Laboratory to better understand relationships between anisotropic mechanical properties, mineral composition, and texture of clay-rich soils as they evolve during consolidation to high effective stresses, research that spans the domains of soil mechanics and rock mechanics.
