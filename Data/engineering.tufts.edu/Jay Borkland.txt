Research Interests: Jay Borkland's research interests include the assessment and remediation of contaminated sediments from coastal waterways and ports, especially those projects that involve Confined Aquatic Disposal Cells and Shoreline Confined Disposal Facilities. He studies coastal and port infrastructure, including dredging of channels for shipping and the design and construction of piers, wharfs, and marine terminals; particularly where those projects involve contamination. In addition, he focuses on coastal protection and coastal resiliency as a response to rising sea levels and global climate change, and offshore wind, including site characterization, permitting, design, and operation and maintenance of offshore wind farms in the U.S. and Europe. He also studies renewable energy from marine resources, and the geophysical, geotechnical, ecological, and biological assessment of coastlines.
