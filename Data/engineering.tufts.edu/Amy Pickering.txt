Research Interests: Amy Pickering's research combines tools from multiple disciplines (engineering, epidemiology, microbiology) to study enteric disease transmission pathways among households in low-income countries and to identify low-cost and scalable interventions to interrupt them. She also studies links between our changing climate and waterborne transmission of human pathogens, with an aim to identify sustainable mitigation strategies for vulnerable populations.
