Research Interests: Dan Kuchma's research interests include the design and behavior of reinforced and prestressed concrete structures subject to complex states of stress. Some of his recent activities involve investigating the behavior of structural concrete designed by the strut-and-tie method as well as the shear design of high-strength concrete bridge girders. In addition, Kuchma is studying how advanced instrumentation methods can be used in physical experiments for the development, calibration, and validation of more comprehensive and reliable numerical models.
