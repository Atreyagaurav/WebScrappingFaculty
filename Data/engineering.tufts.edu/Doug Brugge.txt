Research Interests: Doug Brugge directs the Community Assessment of Freeway Exposure and Health (CAFEH), a set of studies about ultrafine particles caused by traffic and their association with cardiovascular health risk (funded by NIEHS, NHLBI, EPA, HUD, and the Kresge Foundation). Brugge also directs the Tufts Community Research Center (funded by Tisch College). His research includes studies of asthma, traffic-related pollution, the impact of culture and language on health communication, the health impact of environmental tobacco smoke, motor vehicle-related injuries, and the impact of uranium mining and processing on Navajo communities. Most of his work uses a community-based participatory research approach.
