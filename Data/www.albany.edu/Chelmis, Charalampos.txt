Research Interests
Dr. Chelmis is interested in modeling, algorithmic, computational, and practical aspects of all V's of Big Data with a focus on graph data and applications to data science. Previously, he was Senior Research Associate with the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, CA. Dr. Chelmis is addressing challenges related to Volume, Velocity, Variety, Variability, and Veracity to create Value. In his research, he exploits tools from graph theory, complex networks, data mining, machine learning, and data integration.
