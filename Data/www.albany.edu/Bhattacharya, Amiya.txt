Research Interests
My ongoing research interests are in developing intelligent and exploratory simulation technology for realistic modeling of collective behavior of complex adaptive systems, such as large crowd. The end goal is to design a software system and that can be used by event planners to make safe, secure and resilient event plans, as well as provide tools to manage on-the-y monitoring and control for emergency response and crowd evacuation. The key idea is to use machine learning techniques at the planning stage (mostly unsupervised learning) to drive the agent-based simulations to explore not only common cases but also rare and potentially catastrophic events.
