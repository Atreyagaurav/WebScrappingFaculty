Research Interests
Dr. Dutta’s research
        lies at the crossroads of communication theory, networked systems and radio
        architectures that spans from novel MAC-PHY cross-layer solutions in modern
        wireless networks to cognitive radio networks. His research has
        produced fast and efficient MAC layer protocols by incorporating various signal
        processing subsystems of OFDM based physical layers. He has deep experience in
        architecting and designing flexible radio platforms for research and has worked
        on knowledge representation methods for complex physical layers in cognitive
        radio networks. Currently, he focuses on solutions, driven by devices at the
        network edge to make the wireless channel robust against interference, while
        addressing the challenge of being always best-connected over heterogeneous
        networks. His solutions employ a hybrid method of theoretical rigor and
        experimental evaluation using prototype hardware and wireless measurements.
