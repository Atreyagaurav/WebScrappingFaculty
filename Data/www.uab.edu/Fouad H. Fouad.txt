Research and Teaching Interests

Dr. Fouad’s research expertise in green materials and construction methods has a global perspective. He has been working in the area of highway sign and traffic signal supports since for the past 20 years. As principal investigator on several NCHRP and DOT projects, he led a team of experts from U.S. universities whose efforts culminated in the development of the current, newly and totally revised, AASHTO Standard Specifications for Structural Supports for Highway Signs, Luminaries, and Traffic Signals. Continued research efforts in this area resulted in revising the AASHTO Standard Specifications a number of times, and the recent inclusion of fatigue provisions for the design of highway signs and traffic signal support structures.
