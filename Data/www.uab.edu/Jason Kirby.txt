Teaching and Research Interests

Kirby’s primary UAB faculty role has been the development of online, blended, and traditional courses/programs (domestic and international) that educate young engineers on the importance of environmental engineering and sustainable construction/development. The desired outcome is to make his students aware that modern engineering can be advanced while coupled with environmental preservation (17 unique course offerings).


    His academic research has similarly evolved around the theme that environmental engineering can be of benefit to society and not just through the identification, monitoring and treatment of adverse anthropogenic activities. Recent funding has been secured through industrial grants as well as federal awards from the DOE, DOT, and NSF.
