Research Interests: Dr. Hsu has been Principal and Co-Principal Investigator on funded projects for over 30 years, and has received project funding amounting to over 3.5 millions, including 14 grants from National Science Foundation totaling 2.2 millions. He established the University of Houston’s Structural Research Laboratory, which is widely recognized and has supported over thirty Ph. D., M. S., and post-doctoral students. His research work has formed the basis for the shear and torsion design provisions in the American concrete Institute Building Code. His current research interests are in concrete, concrete structures, and structural mechanics.

		Shear behavior of prestressed concrete membrane elements

		Shear design of prestressed concrete beams

		Steel fibers in prestressed concrete beams

		Cyclic constitutive laws of reinforced and prestressed concrete elements

		Cracking in reinforced concrete inverted-T pile caps

		Seismic behavior of concrete buildings and bridges, including ductility and energy dissipation

		Torsion in reinforced concrete structures

		New innovative materials for buildings and bridges, including high performance concrete, 3-D steel wire grids, and fiber reinforced plastic
