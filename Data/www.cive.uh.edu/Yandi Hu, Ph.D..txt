Research Interests: From the nanoscale to the macroscale, my overarching aim is to apply advanced materials, techniques, and expertise in nanochemistry and geochemistry to multidisciplinary areas. Some specific interests include:   engineered nucleation and growth of nanomaterials for biomedical and industrial applications, and surface and subsurface geochemical reactions related to geologic CO2 sequestration and hydraulic fracture operations, heavy metal immobilization, and scale formation control.
