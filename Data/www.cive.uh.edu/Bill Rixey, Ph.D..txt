Research Interests: Physicochemical processes applied to groundwater protection: chemical fate and transport, subsurface remediation of hazardous chemicals, and environmental risk assessment.
Bill’s research emphasizes the physico-chemical mechanisms that control the release of organic compounds from soil impacted by fuel-based NAPL (nonaqueous phase liquid) mixtures (e.g., gasoline, crude oil, coal tar liquids, etc.). Current research projects are investigating the source generation and groundwater impacts of ethanol and other bioalcohols used in reformulated gasoline and on the mobility of NAPLs in soils. This research is important for understanding how to respond to spills of fuels containing alcohols as well as establishing ultimate levels of clean-up of contaminants in soil that are based on quantitative assessments of risk to the environment.
