 My research area is hydraulics and sediment transport focusing on experimental study of turbulence flow field and computational simulation of flow and sediment transport in rivers.  My research objective is to advance the fundamental knowledge and develop the state-of-the-art computational models in the area of hydraulics and sediment transport through basic and applied research.
