Teaching
 Undergraduate Education:Course Experience and Relevant Activities:- Fundamentals of Engineering Design—Hands-on team based experience for freshmen.- Engineering Mechanics, Statics—Core Engineering course.- Computer programming for Civil Engineers.- Strength of Materials—This core course is currently being modified to incorporate learning via the internet, particularly with respect to interactive homework completion. It has also been taught in Grenoble, France, during a sabbatical leave.- Engineering Design Graphics—Computer based drafting.- Junior Field Trip—Practicum experience for Juniors.- Materials Laboratory—experimental property identification of various engineering materials.- Engineering Design—Senior design project, a major, team based, Engineering Project.- Introductory Finite Element Analysis—Technical elective course for seniors- Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering Senior Design Project (team mentoring).Graduate Education:Course Experience and Relevant Activities:- Theory of Elasticity and Applications—Research as well as application oriented basic elasticity theory; students majoring in various Engineering disciplines (Mechanics, Aerospace, Mechanical, Mining, Applied Math, etc.) take this course.- Plasticity Theory and Applications—Computationally and research oriented plasticity for “traditional” and modern materials.- Energy Methods in Mechanics—This “classical” course has been extended to include energy based stability, and chaotic behavior of structures.- Continuum Mechanics—Basic principles of solid mechanics.- Fracture Mechanics—This includes traditional and nontraditional themes, i.e. statistical fracture, scaling phenomena, numerical analysis, etc.Advanced tools, i.e. symbolic computations by computer, and numerical computations using the program Mathematica have been incorporated in some graduate courses.Multimedia technologies are progressively incorporated into undergraduate and graduate education.Research
