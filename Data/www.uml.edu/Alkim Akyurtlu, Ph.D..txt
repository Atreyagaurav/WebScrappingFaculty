Research InterestsThe design, fabrication and characterization of metamaterials (computational electromagnetics, electromagnetic metamaterials, complex media, micro- and nano-scale device modeling, antennas). Prof. Akyurtlu’s work involves developing novel low-loss metamaterials in the microwave to the visible regime and application of these materials in antennas and other optical devices. She has been funded by NSF, AFOSR, DARPA, AFRL as well as several industry partners.
